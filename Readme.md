# Amazon Clone Project

This project is a simple Amazon clone built using HTML and CSS. I created this project to enhance and brush up my CSS skills. The goal was to replicate the basic structure and styling of the Amazon website.

## Features

- **HTML and CSS**: The project is built entirely using HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/traworld/Amazon_Clone.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Explore the Amazon clone and see the applied styles.
